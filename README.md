# Project: Calculator

<ins>Prompt:</ins>
Create a standard calculator that performs calculations given  
operations. Standard operations: AC(clear), +/-, %, add, subtract, multiply,   divide, decimal. 

<ins>Goals:</ins>
1. Use React for components and Redux for state management.  
2. Clean and optimized code with comments.  
3. Responsive web design, CSS styling.
4. Pay attention to React lifecycles and implement   
lifecycle management as needed.

<ins>Challenges:</ins>
1. Attempted too many things at once
2. Focus on the internal logic, start basic, build up complexity
3. Simple solution is better than complex
4. Focused on just creating a project with React first

<ins>Known bugs:</ins>
1. ~~Zero will not appear before decimal point~~
2. ~~Spamming multiple operators in a row will result in error~~
3. ~~Ignore operators that are entered before numbers~~
4. ~~Display error message if dividing by zero~~

<ins>To Do: </ins>
1. Fix bugs
2. Attempt project again with React and Redux,  
 and again with React Hooks, then compare efficency

 # Day 2:

 Fixed bugs #2-4
 Still need to fix bug #1
 New bug: Limit display character limit to prevent overflow

 # Day 3:

 Fixed remaining bugs:  
 Added leading 0 in front of decimal point if no other numbers  
 Removed trailing 0's  
 Included negative sign, decimal, and e sign into character count  
 Set maximum character limit to 9  
 Added comments  
 Applied DRY principle  
 Updated to allow for floating point calculations
